## Introduction
As we all know deep learning has shown super power in image processing, so a lot researchers try to study NLP tasks with deep learning, and a various of 
deep nlp models haven discussion, that's what I want to do to collect the deep nlp models which can get the state-of-art performance, so that we can use
those models in industry.

## NLP Tasks <a name="tasks"></a>
This part will introduce useful deep learning models in nlp tasks, and we try to make it available in industry. And the models will contain basic tasks
like classification, text similarity matching, named entity recognition, ctr and some higher models(seq2seq) 
### Text Matching <a name="text_match"></a>
Text matching are wide used in infromation retrieval, question answering, conversational response ranking etc, so we choose some simple and easy
models, and implement them in an enffiency way with tensorflow. As a start, I will implement a baseline with [DSSM](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/dssm/)  
and the introduction about this model in [here](https://github.com/syw2014/DeepNLP-models/blob/master/docs/dssm.md).
